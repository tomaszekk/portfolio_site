# Project Overview

In this project I used a given web-based application from Udacity that reads RSS feeds. I based on prepared tests' form written in [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/). I wrote all required test cases.

# Installation

All you need is to complete following steps:
a. Clone / download a project from my repository: https://github.com/tomaszekk/portfolio_site/tree/master/Project%204
b. Run index.html into a web browser
c. The web browser loads app.js from /js and test cases provided in jasmine/spec/, a file - feedreader.js

# The test cases structures

Test cases are assigned to test suites:
a. RSS Feeds
b. The menu
c. Initial Entries
d. New Feed Selection

For details go to feedreader.js (look for comments) in jasmine/spec
